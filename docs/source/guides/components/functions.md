# Functions

## Writing Custom Functions

The `Function` class serves as a base class for all functions in Context Manager. The idea of the `Function` class is to transform a state dictionary. Tools and functions can be added to the function, as well as configure the function with parameters.

## Creating a Custom Function

To create a custom function, you need to inherit from the `Function` class and implement the abstract methods `setup`, `acall`, and `aprocess_doc`.

### Inherit from the `Function` Class

Create a new class that inherits from `Function`.

```python
from vss_ctx_rag.base.function import Function

class CustomFunction(Function):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name)
```

### Implement the `setup` Method

The `setup` method is used to initialize the function. It should return a dictionary of parameters that will be used by the function.
In this method, you can get params and tools that are added to the function.

```python
def setup(self) -> dict:
    """
    Initialize the function.
    """
    self.batch_size = self.get_param("params", "batch_size")
    self.vector_db = self.get_tool("vector_db")
    return {}
```

### Implement the `acall` Method

The `acall` method is used to asynchronously call the function. The input is a state, represented by a dictionary. The output should also be a state dictionary.

```python
def acall(self, state: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Call the function.
    """
    ## Do some work here
    return {"new_key": "new_value"}
```

### Implement the `aprocess_doc` Method

The `aprocess_doc` method is used to process a document.

```python
def aprocess_doc(self, doc: str, doc_i: int, doc_meta: dict):
    """
    Process a document.
    """
    ## Database operations can be done here
```

### Add the Function to the Context Manager

To add the function to the Context Manager, use the `add_function` method. Add tools and functions to the function, as well as configure the function with parameters here.
```python
ctx_manager.add_function(
    CustomFunction("custom_function")
    .add_tool(LLM_TOOL_NAME, self.llm)
    .config(**config)
    .done()
)
```

### Optional: Add a Function to another Function

A function can also be added to another function.

```python
function.add_function(
    CustomFunction("custom_function")
    .add_function(
        CustomFunction("custom_function_2")
        .add_tool(LLM_TOOL_NAME, self.llm)
        .config(**config)
        .done()
    )
    .config(**config)
    .done()
)
```
