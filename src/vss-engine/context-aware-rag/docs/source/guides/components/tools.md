# Tools

## Adding Custom Tools

Tools are components that can be used in functions. Tools can include LLMs, databases, etc.

### Create a New Tool Class

1. **Inherit from the `Tool` Class**: Start by creating a new class that inherits from the `Tool` class. This will serve as the base for your custom tool.

```python
from vss_ctx_rag.base.tool import Tool

class CustomTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name)
```


### Implement Tool Methods

**Define Tool-Specific Methods**: Implement any methods that your tool needs to perform its tasks. These methods can interact with external services or perform computations.

```python
def say_hello(self):
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Integrate the Tool into a Function

**Add the Tool to a Function**: Use the `add_tool` method to add your custom tool into a function. This allows the function to utilize the tool's capabilities.

```python
custom_tool = CustomTool("custom_tool")

CustomFunction("custom_function_2")
    .add_tool("custom_tool", custom_tool)
    .config(**config)
    .done()
```
Now in our function setup, a tool can be retrieved by name.

```python
tool = self.get_tool("custom_tool")
tool.say_hello()
```
